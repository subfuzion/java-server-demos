# These markdown rules are enforced by CI builds
# - .github/workflows/markdown_linter.yml
#
# You can run a markdown lint check before submitting a pull request:
#   npm install -g markdownlint-cli2
#   markdownlint-cli2 'content/**.md'
#   # or to lint and fix:
#   markdownlint-cli2-fix 'content/**.md'
# 
# Rules for markdownlint-cli2 (https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2)
# Based on markdownlint library (https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint)
# (same linter as vscode-markdownlint).
# See rules descriptions here:
# https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/Rules.md
